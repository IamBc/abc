# ABC

An anonymous image board (think 4chan/2chan) which doesn't store any personal information and the threads and attachments are deleted after a certain period. The design allows several image boards to be hosted on the same backend.

## Installation

### Packages

In order to run ABC you need to have the following packages installed:

PostgreSQL
Go(lang) (Version 1.5+)
Although the names of the packages may vary from distribution to distribution for ubuntu/debian you can go with
```
 sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib
 sudo apt-get install golang
 ```

### Golang Libraries

 All go libraries come with this source, you don't have to install anything extra.


## Build
 Inside the project root, run ```build_server.sh``` It will compile and build the binary. After that it will run the automated tests. If the build fails it means that something in the environment (such as a database is not configured)

## Creating a database
 Run the 	```create_database.sh``` create database script to create a database. You should change the name of the database, the db user and it's password!

## Run

Run the script ``` run_server.sh```  to run the compiled binary. Before that you should check if the configuration of the run_server.sh is correct. It is  done via environment variables. The default ones should work if you have created the database with the default settings and your default ports are free. It is recommended to
change the default ports and database credentials

## Configuration (System)
The system configuration is set in the run_server.sh file which creates the environment and runs the already compiled
binary.
